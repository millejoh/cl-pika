This is a demo to show off some of the features of the 'dormouse' common lisp windowing
GUI, available at http://bitbucket.org/eeeickythump/cl-dormouse/

Unpack everything into a directory and run guidemo1.exe
It is likely that libtcod-mingw.dll and SDL.dll also need to be in the same
directory as the executable -- try copying them there if you have problems.
